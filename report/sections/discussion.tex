Our analysis offers insights into how energy imports might interact with
European energy infrastructures and what economic benefit they can bring. Our
results show that imports of green energy reduce costs of a carbon-neutral
European energy system by 5\% (\bneuro{37}), noting, however, that the
uncertainty range is considerable and potential cost savings strongly depend on
the assumptions made. Nevertheless, our results present a quantitative basis for
further discussions about the trade-offs between system cost, carbon neutrality,
public acceptance, and energy security pertaining to the import of low-carbon
fuels and assess the extent to which infrastructure policy decisions depend on
the path taken on energy imports.

This is particularly relevant as factors other than pure costs might drive the
import strategy. Given the relatively limited cost benefit of imports and value
chain reordering, there could be a case against pursuing this avenue.
Geopolitical considerations could shift the focus towards energy sovereignty and
independence through self-sufficient supply, but also towards imports to
strengthen trade relations and diversify energy supply chains. Low reliance on
imports from few countries and rigid infrastructures like pipelines could
mitigate the risks of sudden supply disruptions and enhance the resilience of
the energy supply. An important consideration is also the economic outflow
caused by imports, shifting value creation to other parts of the world with
potential repercussions on local jobs. Furthermore, while we assessed the import
and relocation of steel production, we did not consider the import of
intermediate products like sponge iron, which has undergone the most
energy-intensive part of the value chain and simultaneously presents a good that
is transportable at low cost.

There is also a social dimension to the import strategy and the question of how
fast the aspired infrastructure can get built. Therefore, policymaking might
prefer easy-to-implement systems featuring, for instance, lower domestic
infrastructure requirements, reuse of existing infrastructure, lower technology
risk, and reduced land usage for broader public support than the most
cost-effective solution. Ultimately, Europe's energy strategy must balance cost
savings from green energy and material imports with broader concerns like
geopolitics, economic development and public opinion to ensure a swift, secure
and sustainable energy future.
