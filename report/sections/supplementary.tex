\section*{Limitations}

Several limitations of the study should be noted. The model is a simplified
representation of the energy system and does not capture all aspects of the
real-world transition. First of all, the optimization results represent a
long-term equilibrium that does not account for the transition process from the
mostly fossil-based energy system to a carbon-neutral one. This means that the
model does not capture constraints regards neither the mid-term ramp-up of green
energy export capacities nor the speed at which supporting infrastructure could
scale up. Furthermore, global competition betweeen potential exporting
countries, as well as between importing countries, make import volumes and
prices more difficult to predict than our purely cost-based analysis can
provide. Besides unclear market developments, local issues in exporting regions
such as potential water scarcity to produce large amounts of hydrogen in
renewable-rich but arid countries is not addressed. Moreover, the fact that we
assume that import costs are not time-dependent and available on demand may
underestimate some intermediate storage requirements for imports at
entry-points, especially for hydrogen.

In terms of industry relocation within Europe, our modelling is constrained to
the migration of steel, ammonia and chemicals. Other sectors like concrete and
alumina production is not considered for relocation. We make this choice so that
relocation within Europe can compete with imports from abroad, which equates a
migration of the industry branch out of the European value chain. Potential
repurcussions on local jobs and relocatoin costs are not captured by the model.
Finally, it should be acknowledged that our assumptions about the broad
availability of district heating networks across Europe to absorb
\mbox{power-to-X} waste heat are relatively progressive as it is not certain
that central heating will become available in regions which have not based their
heating supply on district heating so far.
