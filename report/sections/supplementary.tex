    \caption{\textbf{Examples for potential import cost increases or decreases.}
    The table presents cost sensitivities in absolute and relative terms based
    on the supply chain for producing Fischer-Tropsch fuels in Argentina for
    export to Europe. The reference fuel import cost for this case is 109.8
    \euro{}/MWh. Responses to changes in the input assumptions are not
    additive.}
    \label{tab:cost-uncertainty}
\end{table*}


In \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}, we vary some of the techno-economic assumptions
for evaluating green fuel supply chains in the exporting countries to justify
the range of import cost deviations from the defaults. These relate to
technology costs, financing costs, excess power and heat handling, fuel
synthesis flexibility, and the availability of geological hydrogen storage and
alternative sources of CO$_2$. For all the following sensitivities, it should be
noted that they are not additive.

A higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC) than the uniformly applied 7\%,
e.g.~due to higher project risks, and lower WACC, e.g.~due to the
government-backing of a project, have a substantial effect on the import cost
calculations; an increase or decrease by just one percentage point already
alters the costs per unit of energy by more than
7\%.
 
Likewise, a failure to achieve the anticipated cost reductions for electrolysers
and DAC systems would also result in far-reaching cost increases for green
energy imports, especially if the fuel contains carbon. The availability of
biogenic CO$_2$ (or fossil CO$_2$ from industrial processes that is largely
cycled between use and synthesis and, hence, not emitted to the atmosphere) can
reduce the green fuel cost by 20\% if it can be provided for 60 \euro{}/t and by
10\% if made available for 100 \euro{}/t.

The default assumptions for export supply chains assume islanded fuel synthesis
sites that are not connected to the local electricity system. The isolation
drives the system into high curtailment rates of 8\%. If surplus electricity
production could be sold and absorbed by the local power grid, considerable cost
reductions could be achieved (refer to \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}).

Besides integration with the local energy system, process integration using
waste heat streams from power-to-X plants for direct air capture and flexible
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis similar to methanolisation can also reduce fuel cost
by 3-5\% each. Conditions that would allow for geological hydrogen storage
reduce the need for flexible synthesis plant operation and could reduce import
costs by more than 7\%. However, even though many potential export countries
possess geological hydrogen storage potential, suitable storage sites are not
always co-located with the countries' best renewable potentials.

Finally, cost rises can also be expected if the most competitive exporting
countries are not offering to export green energy. Argentina and Chile have a
margin of 10 \euro{}/MWh over the next cheapest exporting country
(i.e.~Australia, Algeria and Libya with 120 \euro{}/MWh). If these countries
were unavailable for import, costs would rise by almost 10\%.

\section*{Limitations}

Several limitations of the study should be noted. The model is a simplified
representation of the energy system and does not capture all aspects of the
real-world transition. First of all, the optimization results represent a
long-term equilibrium that does not account for the transition process from the
mostly fossil-based energy system to a carbon-neutral one. This means that the
model does not capture constraints regards neither the mid-term ramp-up of green
energy export capacities nor the speed at which supporting infrastructure could
scale up. Furthermore, global competition betweeen potential exporting
countries, as well as between importing countries, make import volumes and
prices more difficult to predict than our purely cost-based analysis can
provide. Besides unclear market developments, local issues in exporting regions
such as potential water scarcity to produce large amounts of hydrogen in
renewable-rich but arid countries is not addressed. Moreover, the fact that we
assume that import costs are not time-dependent and available on demand may
underestimate some intermediate storage requirements for imports at
entry-points, especially for hydrogen.

In terms of industry relocation within Europe, our modelling is constrained to
the migration of steel, ammonia and chemicals. Other sectors like concrete and
alumina production is not considered for relocation. We make this choice so that
relocation within Europe can compete with imports from abroad, which equates a
migration of the industry branch out of the European value chain. Potential
repurcussions on local jobs and relocatoin costs are not captured by the model.
Finally, it should be acknowledged that our assumptions about the broad
availability of district heating networks across Europe to absorb
\mbox{power-to-X} waste heat are relatively progressive as it is not certain
that central heating will become available in regions which have not based their
heating supply on district heating so far.
