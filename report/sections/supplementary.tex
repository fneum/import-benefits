\section*{Limitations}

potential water scarcity to produce large amounts of hydrogen in arid regions

no pathways (e.g. when imports will be available, how quickly supporting infrastructure can scale up )

ignoring interactions in the industry sector between steel production, chemicals industry and heat integration

potential repurcusssions and local transition burden of moving industry not captured

only some industries are allowed to relocate (those where we allow imports)
- yes: steel, ammonia, chemicals (indirectly)
- no: concrete, alumina

and this does not factor in relocation costs

import costs are not time-dependent and assumed to be available on demand (may underestimate some intermediate storage requirement of imports)

optimistic on district heating and therefore use of PtX waste heat almost anywhere

global competition make prices and volumes difficult to predict
