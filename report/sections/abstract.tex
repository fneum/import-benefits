% 5 things a good abstract needs:

% 1. Introduce the topic,
Importing renewable energy to Europe offers many potential benefits, including
reduced energy costs, bypassed delays in infrastructure development, and
decreased land-use pressure by leveraging the abundant renewable resources of
various potential export countries.
% 2. State the unknown,
However, the extent of achievable cost reductions, favourable import volumes and
vectors, and their impact on Europe's domestic energy infrastructure needs
remain uncertain.
% 3. Outline the method used to answer the question,
This study integrates the TRACE global energy supply chain model with the
sector-coupled energy system model PyPSA-Eur to explore scenarios with varying
import volumes, costs, and vectors.
% 4. Preview the findings, and
We find system cost reductions of 1-14\%, depending on assumed import costs,
with diminishing returns for larger import volumes and a preference for
methanol, steel and hydrogen imports. Nevertheless, keeping some domestic
power-to-X production is beneficial for integrating variable renewables,
utilising waste heat and leveraging local carbon sources.
% 5. Tell us what your work teaches us.
Our findings highlight the need for coordinating import strategies with
infrastructure policy and reveal maneuvering space for non-cost decision
factors.
