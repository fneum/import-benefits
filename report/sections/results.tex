\section*{Combinations and volumes of fuel and material imports for highest cost savings}

In \cref{fig:sensitivity-bars}, we first explore the cost reduction potential of
various energy and material import options. Starting from total energy system
costs of \bneuro{768} in the absence of energy imports, we find that enabling
imports from outside of Europe and considering all import vectors can reduce
total energy system costs by up to \bneuro{37}, which corresponds to a relative reduction
of 4.9\%.
% JH for the narrative it might be nicer to use the format "percentage
% (absolute)", e.g. 4.9% (37 bn€/a), throughout the paper
For cost-optimal imports, around 71\% of these costs are used to develop domestic
energy infrastructure. The remaining 29\% are spent on importing a volume of
52~Mt of green steel and around 2700 TWh of green energy, which is almost a
quarter of the system's total energy supply.

% JH we can already ref. to fig 3 (import mix) in this sentence, I think that would help

% TB We now explore the impact of restricting subsets of import options.
A more granular inspection of the results indicates varied cost savings when
only subsets of import options are available. The maximum savings are reduced to
\bneuro{22} (3\%) if hydrogen is excluded from the available import options.
This value is similar to the savings of \bneuro{21} (2.8\%) achieved when only
hydrogen can be imported. Here, pipeline-based hydrogen imports are preferred to
imports as liquid fuel by ship.
% TB Why is this interesting? What does it explain? Start with restriction:
% "If only hydrogen can be imported, savings are still substantial, since the model can take advantage of cheap electricity abroad and do synthesis of derivatives in Europe."
Focusing an import strategy exclusively on
liquid carbonaceous fuels derived from hydrogen, like methanol or
Fischer-Tropsch fuels, consistently achieves cost savings of \bneuro{13-19}
(1.7-2.5\%).

On the contrary, restricting options to only ammonia or methane imports yields
negligible cost savings and small savings below \bneuro{4} (0.6\%) if only
electricity or steel can be imported. This can be explained by the lower variety
and volume of potential usage options compared to energy carriers higher
upstream in the value chain. Generally, our results indicate a preference for
chemicals, like methanol and hydrogen, and materials over electricity imports,
with a strategic mix of imports emerging as the most cost-effective approach.
For insights into how varying import costs affect these findings, refer to
\sfigref{fig:si:subsets}.

\section*{Varying roles of imports for different energy carriers}

\cref{fig:import-shares} outlines which carriers are imported in which
quantities in relation to their total supply when the vector and volume can be
flexibly chosen. Significantly, all methanol, which is used in shipping and
industry, as well as all crude steel, is imported. Also, around three-quarters
of the total hydrogen supply is imported. This is mainly done to subsequently
process the hydrogen into derivative products domestically rather than direct
applications for hydrogen. Smaller import shares are observed for electricity,
Fischer-Tropsch fuels and ammonia, which are mostly domestically produced. For
the example of ammonia, this can be explained by lower levelised cost for
domestic production of 69 \euro{}/MWh compared to 83 \euro{}/MWh for imported
ammonia, which can be attributed to the additional revenue from waste heat
streams in the domestic supply chain. In energy terms, cost-optimal imports
comprise around 50\% hydrogen, more than 20\% electricity and an equal amount of
carbonaceous fuels. It should be noted, however, that different carriers have
undergone further conversion steps abroad with energy losses and that the
cost-optimal import mix also depends on the assumed import costs.

\section*{Sensitivity of potential cost savings to unit costs of energy imports}

This uncertainty of estimates for import costs is addressed in
\cref{fig:sensitivity-costs}. \cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:A} highlights the
extensive range in potential cost reductions if higher or lower import costs
could be attained as well as the resulting variance in cost-effective import
blends. Within $\pm 20\%$ of the default import costs previously presented
applied to all carriers but electricity, total cost savings vary between
\bneuro{12} (1.6\%) and \bneuro{78} (10.2\%) with import volumes ranging between
1700 and 3800~TWh. Across most of these scenarios, there is a stable role for
methanol, steel, electricity and hydrogen imports. One significant difference is
the appearance of Fischer-Tropsch fuel imports starting from cost reductions of
10\%.

Some potential causes for such cost variations are presented in
\cref{tab:cost-uncertainty} and discussed later. Some of these only affect the
cost of carbonaceous fuels. One central assumption for carbon-based fuels is
that imported fuels rely exclusively on direct air capture (DAC) as a carbon
source. For example, arguments for this assumption relate to the potential
remoteness of the ideal locations for renewable fuel production or the absence
of industrial point sources in the exporting country.
% JH or necessary carbon infrastructure
On the other hand,
domestic electrofuels can mostly use less expensive captured carbon dioxide from
industrial point sources or biogenic origin. Therefore, the higher cost for DAC
partially cancels out the savings from utilising better renewable resources
abroad, which is one of the reasons why there is substantial power-to-X
production in Europe, even with corresponding import options. The availability
of cheaper biogenic CO$_2$ in the exporting country, for instance, would
make importing carbonaceous fuels more attractive.

When the relative cost variation of $\pm 20\%$ is only applied to carbon-based
fuels (\cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:B}), hydrogen imports are increasingly
displaced by methane and Fischer-Tropsch imports with lower costs. However, it
takes a cost increase of more than 10\% for domestic methanol production to
become more cost-effective than methanol imports.

% JH should this be +/- or only "-" ?

\end{figure*}

% maybe add the meaning of the "black dots" also to the legend

\section*{Attainable cost savings for varying import volumes}

What is consistent across all import cost variations is the flat solution space
around the respective cost-optimal import volumes. Increasing or decreasing the
total amount of imports barely affects system costs within $\pm 1000$ TWh. This
is illustrated in \cref{fig:sensitivity-volume}, which shows the possible cost
reductions as a function of enforced import volumes. A wide range scenarios with
import volumes below 5600~TWh (4000-7500~TWh within $\pm$20\% import costs) have
lower total energy system costs than the scenario without any imports.
% JH I think I understand what you mean, but can we have a different way of
% expressing it? e.g. 4000 TWh at +20% and 7500 TWh at -20% costs)
These values are equivalent
to just more than twice the cost-optimal volumes, which are indicated by the
black markers and correspond to the bars previously shown in
\cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:A}. Naturally, the cost-optimal volume of imports
increases as their costs decrease, but the response weakens with lower import
costs.
% JH sentence/meaning unclear?

As we explore the effect of increasing import volumes on system costs, we find
that already 43\% (36-61\% within $\pm$20\% import costs) of the 4.9\%
(1.6-10.2\%) total cost benefit (\bneuro{16}) can be achieved with the first 500
TWh of imports. This corresponds to only 18\% (15-29\%) of the cost-optimal
import volumes, highlighting the diminishing return of large amounts of energy
imports over domestic production in Europe. While importing 1000 TWh already
realises 70\% of the maximum cost savings with our default assumptions, this
maximum is only obtained for 2800~TWh of imports. For these initial 1000~TWh,
primary crude steel and methanol imports are prioritised, followed by hydrogen
and, subsequently, electricity beyond 2000 TWh. Once more than 5000~TWh are
imported, less than half the total system cost would be spent on domestic energy
infrastructure.

As imports increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the need for domestic
power-to-X (PtX) production and renewable capacities. A large share of the
hydrogen, methanol and raw steel production is outsourced from Europe, reducing
the need for domestic wind and solar capacities. This trend is further characterised by the
displacement of biogas usage in favour of hydrogen imports around the 2000~TWh
mark. An increase in the amount of hydrogen imported coincides with an
increasing use of hydrogen fuel cells for electricity and central heat supply in
district heating networks, partially displacing the use of methane. Regarding
electricity imports, \cref{fig:sensitivity-volume} reveals a predominant
reliance on wind-generated electricity over solar for the imports via HVDC links
from the MENA region.
% TB due to seasonality of MENA wind?
A considerable share of the costs can be attributed to
long-distance power transmission.

% Furthermore, large amounts of electricity imports are supported by an increase
% in battery deployment to manage the imported power more effectively.

For deviating levels of import costs, the composition of the domestic system and
import mix is primarily similar (\sfigref{fig:si:volume}). The main differences
are a more prominent role for Fischer-Tropsch fuel imports with lower import
costs and green methane for high import volumes. It should also be noted that
the windows for cost savings are much smaller if only subsets of import options
are available (\sfigref{fig:si:volume-subsets}). However, up to an import
volume of 2000~TWh, excluding electricity imports does not diminish the
cost-saving potential substantially.

\section*{Interdependence of import strategy and domestic energy infrastructures}

Across the range of import scenarios analysed, we find that the strategy taken
on imports strongly affects domestic energy infrastructure needs
(\cref{fig:import-infrastructure}).
% JH I think it would be better to call it "import mix" than "strategy"

% self-sufficiency

In the fully self-sufficient European energy supply scenario, we see large
\mbox{power-to-X} production within Europe to cover the demand for hydrogen
derivatives in steelmaking, high-value chemicals, green shipping and aviation
fuels. Production sites are concentrated in Southern Europe for solar-based
electrolysis and the broader North Sea region for wind-based electrolysis. The
steel and ammonia industries relocate to the periphery of Europe in Spain and
Scotland, where hydrogen is cheap and abundant. Electricity grid reinforcements
are focused in Northwestern Europe and long-distance HVDC connections but are
broadly distributed overall. Hydrogen pipeline build-out is strongest in Spain
and France to transport hydrogen from the Southern production hubs to chosen
fuel synthesis sites. Most of these pipelines are used unidirectionally, with
bidirectional usage where pipelines link hydrogen production and low-cost
geological storage sites (for instance, between Greece and Italy and Southern
Spain).
% waste heat discussion comes later

% flexible imports

Considering imports of renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and electrofuels
substantially alters the infrastructure buildout in Europe. Imports displace
much of the European power-to-X production capacities and, particularly,
domestic solar energy generation in Southern Europe. In contrast, the British
Isles retain some domestic electrolyser capacities to produce synthetic methane
locally.
% JH driven by exogeneous fixed methane demand? Or what is the driver for methane production?
The electricity imports are distributed evenly between the North
African countries Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia and across multiple entry points
in Spain, France, Italy and Greece. This facilitates grid integration without
strong reinforcement needs. Electricity imports are also optimised to achieve
higher utilisation rates above 60\% for the HVDC import connections. This is
realised by mixing wind and solar generation for seasonal balancing and using
some batteries for short-term storage (\sfigref{fig:si:import-operation}).

While the amount and locations of domestic power grid reinforcements are not
significantly affected by the import of electricity and other fuels, the extent
of the hydrogen network is halved. Compared to the self-sufficiency scenario,
the cost-benefit of the hydrogen network shrinks from \bneuro{10} (1.3\%) to
\bneuro{3} (0.4\%).
% JH maybe concisely add that h2 pipeline topology is very different (and then
% the longer explanation)
This is caused by substantial amounts of methanol imports
that diminish the demand for hydrogen in Europe and, hence, the need to
transport it. In combination with the steel and ammonia industry relocation,
longer hydrogen pipeline connections are then predominantly built to meet
hydrogen CHP demands to bring electricity and heat to renewables-poor and
grid-poor regions in Eastern Europe and Germany. Moreover, the hydrogen network
helps absorb inbound hydrogen in South and Southeast Europe, transporting some
hydrogen not directly used for fuel synthesis at the entry points to
neighbouring regions.

% overarching trends

A further observation is the high value of power-to-X production for system
integration and the role of waste heat in the siting of fuel synthesis plants
(\sfigref{fig:si:infra-b}). Using the process waste heat in district heating
networks with seasonal thermal storage generates notable cost savings of
\bneuro{10-20} (1.3-2.6\%). Savings are lower when imports displace domestic PtX
infrastructure. To realise these benefits, PtX facilities tend to be located in
densely populated areas (e.g.~Paris or Hamburg), which drives part of the the
hydrogen network. Alongside the flexible operation of electrolysis to integrate
variable wind and solar feed-in and the broad availability of industrial and
biogenic carbon sources in Europe, waste heat usage is a key factor that raises
the attractiveness of electricity and hydrogen imports with subsequent domestic
conversion relative to the direct import of derivative products. Infrastructure
layouts for further import scenarios are presented in \sfigref{fig:si:infra-b}
to \sfigref{fig:si:infra-d}.

% TB move to appendix? - FN maybe, tentatively not

\section*{Causes of import cost uncertainty and their severity}

In \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}, we vary some of the techno-economic assumptions
for evaluating green fuel supply chains in the exporting countries to justify
the range of import cost deviations from the defaults. These relate to
technology costs, financing costs, excess power and heat handling, fuel
synthesis flexibility, and the availability of geological hydrogen storage and
alternative sources of CO$_2$. For all the following sensitivities, it should be
noted that they are not additive.

A higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC) than the uniformly applied 7\%,
e.g.~due to higher project risks, and lower WACC, e.g.~due to the
government-backing of a project, have a substantial effect on the import cost
calculations; an increase or decrease by just one percentage point already
alters the costs per unit of energy by more than
7\%.\cite{egliBiasEnergy2019,bogdanovReplyBias2019,lonerganImprovingRepresentation2023a,schyskaHowRegional2020,steffenDeterminantsCost2022}

Likewise, a failure to achieve the anticipated cost reductions for electrolysers
and DAC systems would also result in far-reaching cost increases for green
energy imports, especially if the fuel contains carbon. The availability of
biogenic CO$_2$ (or CO$_2$ from industrial processes that is largely cycled
between use and synthesis and, hence, not emitted to the atmosphere) can reduce
the green fuel cost by 20\% if it can be provided for 60 \euro{}/t and by 10\%
if made available for 100 \euro{}/t.

The default assumptions for export supply chains assume islanded fuel synthesis
sites that are not connected to the local electricity system. The isolation in
consideration of the investment costs of the various components drives the
system into high curtailment rates of 8\%. If surplus electricity production
could be sold and absorbed by the local power grid, considerable cost reductions
could be achieved (refer to \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}).
%  depending on the average selling price, reducing curtailment

Besides integration with the local energy system, process integration using
waste heat streams from power-to-X plants for direct air capture and flexible
Fischer-Tropsch synthesis similar to methanolisation can also reduce fuel cost
by 3-5\% each. Conditions that would allow for geological hydrogen storage
reduce the need for flexible synthesis plant operation and could reduce import
costs by more than 7\%. However, even though many countries considered to be
exporting possess geological hydrogen storage potential, the sites are not
always co-located with the countries' best renewable potentials.
\cite{hevinUndergroundStorage2019}

Finally, cost rises can also be expected if the most competitive exporting
countries are not offering to export green energy. Argentina and Chile have a
margin of 9.5 \euro{}/MWh over the next cheapest exporting country
(i.e.~Australia, Algeria and Libya with 113 \euro{}/MWh). If these countries
were unavailable for import, costs would rise by almost 10\%.
