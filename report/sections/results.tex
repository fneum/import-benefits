\section*{Combinations and volumes of fuel and material imports leading to highest cost savings}

In \cref{fig:sensitivity-bars}, we explore the cost reduction potential of
various energy and material import options. Starting from total energy system
costs of \bneuro{768} in the absence of energy imports, we find that enabling
imports from outside of Europe and considering all import vectors can reduce
total energy system costs by up to \bneuro{37}, which corresponds to a reduction
by 4.9\%. In this case, around 71\% of these costs are used to develop domestic
energy infrastructure, while the remaining 29\% are spent on importing a volume
of 52~Mt of green steel and around 2700 TWh of green energy, which is almost a
quarter of the system's total energy supply.

A more granular inspection of the results indicates varied cost savings when
only subsets of import options are available. The maximum savings are reduced to
\bneuro{22} (3\%) if hydrogen is excluded from the available import options.
This value is similar to the savings of \bneuro{21} (2.8\%) achieved when only
hydrogen can be imported. Here, pipeline-based hydrogen imports are preferred to
imports as liquid fuel by ship. Focusing an import strategy exclusivley on
liquid carbonaceous fuels derived from hydrogen like methanol or Fischer-Tropsch
fuels consistently achieves cost savings of \bneuro{13-19} (1.7-2.5\%). On the
contrary, restricting options to only ammonia or methane imports yields
negligible cost savings, and small savings below \bneuro{4} (0.6\%) if only
electricity or steel can be imported. This can be explained by the lower variety
and volume for potential usage options compared to energy carriers higher
upstream in the value chain. Generally, our results indicate a preference for
chemicals, like methanol and hydrogen, and materials over electricity imports,
with a strategic mix of imports emerging as the most cost-effective approach.
For insights into how varying import costs affect these findings, refer to
\sfigref{fig:si:subsets}.

\section*{Varying roles of imports for different energy carriers}

\cref{fig:import-shares} outlines which carriers are imported in which
quantities in relation to their total supply when the vector and volume can be
flexibly chosen. Significantly, all methanol, which is used in shipping and
industry, as well as all crude steel is imported. Also around three quarters of
the toal hydrogen supply is imported. This is done mostly to subsequently
process the hydrogen into derivative products domestically rathern than direct
applications for hydrogen. Smaller import shares are observed for electricity,
Fischer-Tropsch fuels and ammonia, which are mostly produced domestically. For
the example of ammonia, this can be explained by lower levelised cost for
domestic production of 69 \euro{}/MWh compared to 83 \euro{}/MWh for imported
ammonia, which can be attributed to the additional revenue from waste heat
streams in the domestic supply chain. In energy terms, cost-optimal imports
comprise around 50\% hydrogen, more than 20\% electricity and an equal amount of
carbonaceous fuels. It should be noted however, that different carriers have
undergone different conversion steps abroad with energy losses and that the
cost-optimal import mix also depends on the assumed import costs.

\section*{Sensitivity of potential cost savings to costs of energy imports}

This uncertainty of estimates for import costs is addressed in
\cref{fig:sensitivity-costs}. \cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:A} highlights the
large range in potential cost reductions if higher or lower import costs could
be attained as well as the resulting variance in cost-effective import blends.
Within $\pm 20\%$ of the default import costs previously presented applied to
all carriers but electricity, total cost savings vary between \bneuro{12}
(1.6\%) and \bneuro{78} (10.2\%) with import volumes ranging between 1700 and
3800~TWh. Across most of these scenarios, there is a stable role for methanol,
steel, electricity and hydrogen imports. One significant difference is the
appearance of Fischer-Tropsch fuel imports starting from cost reductions of
10\%.

Some potential causes for such cost variations are presented in
\cref{tab:cost-uncertainty} and discussed later. Some of these only affect the
cost of carbonaceous fuels. One central assumption for carbon-based fuels is
that imported fuels rely exclusively on direct air capture (DAC) as a carbon
source. Arguments for this assumption relate, for example, to the potential
remoteness of the ideal locations for renewable fuel production or the absence
of industrial point-sources in the exporting country. On the other hand,
domestic electrofuels can mostly use less expensive captured carbon dioxide from
industrial point-sources or biogenic origin. Therefore, the higher cost for DAC
partially cancels out the savings from utilising better renewable resources
abroad, which is one of the reasons why there is substantial power-to-X
production in Europe even with corresponding import options. The availability of
cheaper biogenic CO$_2$ in the exporting country, for instance, would inevitably
make the import of carbonaceous fuels more attractive.

When the relative cost variation of $\pm 20\%$ is only applied to carbon-based
fuels (\cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:B}), hydrogen imports are increasingly
displaced by green methane and Fischer-Tropsch imports with lower costs, but it
takes a cost increase of more than 10\% for domestic methanol production to
become more cost-effective than green methanol imports.

    \label{fig:sensitivity-volume}
\end{figure*}

\section*{Attainable cost savings for different import volumes}

What is consistent across all import cost variations is the flat solution space
around the respective cost-optimal import volumes. Increasing or decreasing the
total amount of imports barely affects system costs within $\pm 1000$ TWh. This
is is illustrated in \cref{fig:sensitivity-volume} which shows the possible cost
reductions as a function of import volumes. A wide range of import volumes below
5600~TWh (4000-7500~TWh within $\pm$20\% import costs) have lower cost than the
scenario without any imports. These values are equivalent to just more than
twice the cost-optimal volumes, which are indicated by the black markers
and correspond to the bars previously shown in \cref{fig:sensitivity-costs:A}.
Naturally, the cost-optimal volume of imports increases as their costs decrease,
but the response weakens with lower import costs.

As we explore the effect of increasing import volumes on system costs, we find
that already 43\% (36-61\% within $\pm$20\% import costs) of the 4.9\%
(1.6-10.2\%) total cost benefit (\bneuro{16}) can be achieved with the first 500
TWh of imports. This corresponds to only 18\% (15-29\%) of the cost-optimal
import volumes, highlighting the diminishing return of large amounts of energy
imports over domestic production in Europe. While importing 1000 TWh already
realises 70\% of the maximum cost savings with our default assumptions, this
maximum is only obtained for 2800~TWh of imports. For these initial 1000~TWh,
primary crude steel and methanol imports are prioritized, followed by hydrogen
and then electricity beyond 2000 TWh. Once more than 5000~TWh are imported, less
than half of the total system cost would be spent on domestic energy
infrastructure.

As imports increase, there is a corresponding decrease in the need for domestic
power-to-X (PtX) production and renewable capacities. A large share of the
hydrogen, methanol and raw steel production is outsourced from Europe, inducing
a reduction in domestic wind and solar capacities. This trend is further
characterised by the displacement of biogas usage in favour of hydrogen imports
around the 2000~TWh mark. An increase in the amount of hydrogen imported
coincides with increasing use of hydrogen fuel cells for electricity and central
heat supply in district heating networks, partially displacing the use of
methane for this purpose. In terms of electricity imports,
\cref{fig:sensitivity-volume} reveals a predominant reliance on wind-generated
electricity over solar for the imports via HVDC links. Here, a considerable
share of the costs can be attributed to realising long-distance power
transmission.

% Furthermore, large amounts of electricity imports are supported by
% an increase in battery deployment to manage the imported power more effectively.

For deviating levels of import costs, the composition of the domestic system and
import mix is mostly similar (\sfigref{fig:si:volume}). The main differences are
a larger role for Fischer-Tropsch fuel imports with lower import costs and for
green methane for high import volumes. It should also be noted that the windows
for cost savings are much smaller if only subsets of import options are
considered (\sfigref{fig:si:volume-subsets}). However, up to an import volume of
2000~TWh, excluding electricity imports does not diminish the cost saving
potential significantly.

\section*{Import strategy strongly affect domestic energy infrastructure needs}

Across the range of import scenarios analysed, we find that the strategy taken
on imports strongly affects domestic energy infrastructure needs
(\cref{fig:import-infrastructure}).

% self-sufficiency

In the scenario with fully self-sufficient European energy supply, we see large
\mbox{power-to-X} production within Europe to cover the demand for hydrogen
derivatives in steelmaking, high-value chemicals, as well as green shipping and
aviation fuels. Production sites are concentrated in Southern Europe for
solar-based electrolysis as well as in the broader North Sea region for
wind-based electrolysis. The steel and ammonia industries relocate to periphery
of Europe in Spain and Scotland, where hydrogen is cheap and abundant.
Electricity grid reinforcements are focused in Northwestern Europe and
long-distance HVDC connections, but overall broadly distributed. Hydrogen
pipelines build-out is strongest in Spain and France to transport hydrogen from
Southern production hub to chosen fuel synthesis sites.
Most of these pipelines are used unidirectionally, with bidirectional usage
where pipelines link hydrogen production and low-cost geological storage sites
(e.g. between Greece and Italy and in Southern Spain).
% waste heat discussion comes later  

% flexible imports

Considering imports of renewable electricity, green hydrogen and electrofuels
substantially alters the infrastructure buildout in Europe. Imports displace
much of the European power-to-X production capacities, and, in particular,
domestic solar energy generation in Southern Europe. In contrast, the British
Isles retain some domestic electrolyser capacities to locally produce synthetic
methane. The electricity imports distribute evenly between the North African
countries Algeria, Libya, Tunisia and also across multiple entrypoints in Spain,
France, Italy and Greece. This facilitates grid integration without strong
reinforcement needs. Electricity imports are also optimised to achieve higher
utilisation rates above 60\% for the HVDC import connections. This is realised
by mixing wind and solar generation for seasonal balancing and using some
batteries for short-term storage (\sfigref{fig:si:import-operation}).

While the amount and locations of domestic power grid reinforcements is not
significantly affected by the import of electricity and other fuels, the extent
of the hydrogen network is halved. Compared to the self-sufficiency scenario,
the cost benefit of the hydrogen network shrinks from \bneuro{10} (1.3\%) to
\bneuro{3} (0.4\%). This is caused by substantial amounts of methanol imports
that diminish the demand for hydrogen in Europe and, hence, the need to
transport it. In combination with the relocation of the steel and ammonia
industry, longer hydrogen pipeline connections are then predominantly built to
meet hydrogen CHP demands in order to bring electricity and heat to
renewables-poor and grid-poor regions in Eastern Europe and Germany. Moreover,
the hydrogen network helps to absorb inbound hydrogen in South and South-East
Europe, transporting some of the hydrogen which is not directly used for fuel
synthesis at the entrypoints to neighbouring regions. 

% overarching trends

A further observation is the high value of power-to-X production for system
integration and the role of waste heat in the siting of fuel synthesis plants
(\sfigref{fig:si:infra-b}). The use of the process waste heat in district
heating networks with seasonal thermal storage generates notable cost savings of
\bneuro{10-20} (1.3-2.6\%), with lower savings when imports displace domestic
PtX infrastructure. To realise these benefits, PtX facilities tend to locate in
densely populated areas (e.g.~Paris or Hamburg), which drives part of the the
hydrogen network. Alongside the flexible operation of electrolysis to integrate
variable wind and solar feed-in and the broad availability of industrial and
biogenic carbon sources in Europe, waste heat usage is a key factor that raises
the attractiveness of electricity and hydrogen imports with subsequent domestic
conversion relative to the direct import of derivative products. Infrastructure
layouts for further import scenarios are presented in \sfigref{fig:si:infra-b}
to \sfigref{fig:si:infra-d}.

\section*{Causes of import cost uncertainty and their severity}

In \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}, we vary some of the techno-economic assumptions
for evaluating green fuel supply chains in the exporting countries in order to
justify the range of import cost deviations from the defaults. These relate to
technology costs, financing costs, the handling of excess power and heat, fuel
synthesis flexibility, and the availability of geological hydrogen storage and
alternative sources of CO$_2$. For all the following sensitivities, it should be
noted that owing to correlation they may not be additive.

A higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in developing or economically
unstable countries than the uniformly applied 7\%, e.g.~due to higher project
risks, and lower WACC, e.g.~due to the government-backing of a project, have a
substantial effect on the import cost calculations; an increase or decrease by
just one percentage point already alters the costs per unit of energy by more
than
7\%.\cite{egliBiasEnergy2019,bogdanovReplyBias2019,lonerganImprovingRepresentation2023a,schyskaHowRegional2020,steffenDeterminantsCost2022}

Likewise, a failure to achieve the anticipated cost reductions for electrolysers
and DAC systems would also result in far-reaching cost increases for green
energy imports, especially if the fuel contains carbon. The availability of
biogenic CO$_2$ (or CO$_2$ from industrial processes that is largely cycled
between use and synthesis and, hence, not emitted to the atmosphere) can reduce
the green fuel cost by 20\% if it can be provided for 60 \euro{}/t and by 10\%
if made available for 100 \euro{}/t.

The default assumptions for export supply chains assume islanded fuel synthesis
sites that are not connected to the local electricity system. The isolation in
consideration of the investment costs of the various components drives the
system into high curtailment rates of 8\%. If surplus electricity production
could be sold and absorbed by the local power grid, considerable cost reductions
could be achieved depending on the average selling price, reducing curtailment
(refer to \cref{tab:cost-uncertainty}). 

Besides integration with the local energy system, process integration by using
waste heat streams from power-to-X plants for direct air capture as well as
flexible Fischer-Tropsch synthesis similar to methanolisation can also reduce
fuel cost by 3-5\% each. Conditions that would allow for geological storage of
hydrogen reduce the need for flexible synthesis plant operation and could reduce
import costs by more than 7\%. However, even though many of the considered
exporting countries possess geological hydrogen storage potential, the sites are
not always co-located with the countries' best renewable potentials
\cite{hevinUndergroundStorage2019}.

Finally, cost rises can also be expected if the most competitive exporting
countries are not offering to export green energy. Argentina and Chile have a
margin of 9.5 \euro{}/MWh over the next cheapest exporting country (i.e.~Australia,
Algeria and Libya with 113 \euro{}/MWh). If these countries were unavailable for
import, costs would rise by almost 10\%.
